JLTSegue
========

Custom segues are fun and useful.

JLTReplaceSegue
---------------

The current view controller is replaced in the navigation controller by a new
view controller after a push animation. This is done by pushing a new view
controller onto the navigation controller stack, then removing the current view
controller from the stack.

JLTTabSegue
-----------

Instead of segueing to a new view controller, segue to a different tab in the
tab bar controller.
